# crypto-app

This application serves as a crypto currency financial tool that allows the user to add crypto coins to a simulated wallet so they can see their financial standing that's calculated using that day.

Currently, the following has been implemented:
- Adding crypto coins to the table
- Adding BUY records to crypto coin table entries
- Adding SELL records to crypto coin table entries
- Realtime API coin price data
- Mobile optimization
- Lazy loading newly added crypto coins when API data isn't available yet
